# balanced-parentesis

# Problem solving
Given a string, determine if it is “balanced”, where “balanced” is defined by having a matching closing parenthesis for each open parenthesis (in the order in which it was opened). The set of all possible characters is: {“(“, ”{“, ”[“ ,“]”, ”}”,“)”}.

- Examples of balanced parenthesis:
  - "((({{{[[[]]]}}})))"
  - “{{{[][][]}}}”
  - “()(){{{}}}[][]”
  - “()()()()”
- Examples of unbalanced parenthesis:
  - “(((())})”
  - “)((()))()()”
  - “((()()()))(()”
